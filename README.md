# Song Generator!
This started life as a simple Codecademy project, it's now a project that I add and improve to in my spare time. The idea is a Random Song Generator that looks through a wide array of popular songs on Guitar and Bass. 

The Generator gives you a part of a song to learn every time you hit generate, helping a new or experienced player learn a new song that may be out of your comfort Zone.
